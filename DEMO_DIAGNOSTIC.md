# Interactive Demo Diagnostic Guide

## Quick Check: Is the Demo Working?

Open your browser console and run:
```javascript
document.querySelector('#mic-button').click()
```

You should see:
1. The demo transitions to split view
2. Left side: Typing with mistakes and corrections
3. Right side: Thought bubbles appear, then documentation emerges

## If the Demo is NOT Working

### Check 1: Verify the JavaScript is loaded

In browser console, type:
```javascript
window.InteractiveDemo
```

If it returns `undefined`, the module isn't loaded.

### Check 2: Verify initialization

Look in `src/js/main.js` for:
```javascript
import { createInteractiveDemo } from './modules/interactive-demo.js';
```

And in the DOMContentLoaded:
```javascript
const demo = createInteractiveDemo('#demo-container');
```

### Check 3: Verify the narrative methods exist

In `src/js/modules/interactive-demo.js`, search for these method names:
- `runNarrative` (NOT `runScenario`)
- `actOne_TheStruggle`
- `actTwo_TheFlow` 
- `actThree_TheUnderstanding`

If these don't exist, the narrative implementation wasn't applied.

### Check 4: Verify thought container creation

Search for `createThoughtsContainer` method in the interactive-demo.js file.

### Check 5: Verify CSS for thought bubbles

In `src/css/components/interactive-demo.css`, search for:
- `.thought-bubble`
- `.flow-word`
- `.emerge-text`

## Manual Fix if Needed

If the narrative methods are missing, the implementation from earlier in this thread needs to be reapplied. The key changes were:

1. Renamed `runScenario` to `runNarrative`
2. Added three "Act" methods for the narrative structure
3. Added typing mistakes and corrections
4. Added thought bubble display
5. Enhanced scenario data with thought processes

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly:

1. **Act 1**: Types "Reset AD pwd - Sarah @ Acme. Added MFA." with realistic mistakes
2. **Act 2**: Natural speech appears word by word with flow
3. **Act 3**: Shows thought bubbles:
   - "Security incident detected"
   - "Identity verification completed"
   - "Root cause: Multiple failed attempts"
   - etc.
4. **Final**: Documentation emerges section by section

## Console Errors to Watch For

- `TypeError: Cannot read property 'thoughtProcess' of undefined` - scenarios not updated
- `this.actOne_TheStruggle is not a function` - narrative methods missing
- `Cannot read property 'style' of null` - thought container not created
