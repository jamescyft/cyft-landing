# Project Ready for Implementation

## ‚úÖ Cleanup Complete

The project structure has been cleaned and organized. All outdated and potentially confusing files have been moved to the `_archive/` folder.

## üìã Files Available for Implementation

### Essential Guides:
1. **`ULTRA_PRECISE_GUIDE.md`** - The main implementation guide with exact line numbers and code
2. **`CURSOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`** - The prompt to give to Cursor
3. **`DEMO_DIAGNOSTIC.md`** - Troubleshooting guide if the interactive demo isn't working

### Project Structure:
- `/src` - All source code (CSS, JS, config)
- `/public` - Static assets
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- Standard config files (package.json, vite.config.js, etc.)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Open `CURSOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`
2. Copy the prompt (everything after the "---" line)
3. Paste it to Cursor
4. Let Cursor follow the implementation step by step

## üéØ Implementation Focus

The implementation will:
1. Add simple fade animation to hero title
2. Set static contrast between story cards
3. Add fade animation to pricing
4. Remove complex JS animations
5. Add form validation styles

The interactive demo (typing with mistakes, thought bubbles) should already be working from previous implementation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

- DO NOT look in the `_archive/` folder - it contains outdated guides
- Follow ONLY `ULTRA_PRECISE_GUIDE.md`
- Test after each change
- The dev server should be running at http://localhost:3000
