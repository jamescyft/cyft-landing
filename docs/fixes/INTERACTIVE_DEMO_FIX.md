# Interactive Demo Fix - Ticket Overlay Not Showing

## Issue Summary
The interactive demo was not completing properly. While it would start and show some animations, it wasn't displaying:
1. The ticket documentation output with "View Detailed Documentation" button
2. The ticket overlay window with complete documentation
3. The reset button to run another scenario

## Root Cause
The critical inline CSS was setting `.demo__doc-output { display: none; }` but there were no corresponding styles to show it when the `is-visible` class was added. The external CSS file had the proper styles, but:
- The critical CSS takes precedence due to specificity
- The external CSS might not load in time
- No `!important` flag to override the display: none

## Fix Applied

### Added Override Styles
In both `src/css/critical-inline.css` and the inline styles in `index.html`:

```css
/* Fix: Add styles to show elements when is-visible class is added */
.demo__split-view.is-visible {
  display: block !important;
}

.demo__doc-output.is-visible {
  display: block !important;
}

.demo__reset.is-visible {
  display: block !important;
}
```

## How the Demo Should Work

1. **Start**: User clicks microphone button
2. **Phase 1**: Shows rushed typing (what techs typically write)
3. **Phase 2**: Shows natural speech debrief with insights
4. **Phase 3**: Shows intelligent processing with feature activation
5. **Phase 4**: Shows documentation summary with "View Detailed Documentation" button
6. **Overlay**: Clicking button shows full ticket documentation in glass pane overlay
7. **Reset**: After closing overlay, shows "See More Scenarios" button
8. **Loop**: Clicking scenarios button starts next demo automatically

## Testing the Fix

1. Preview the site: `npm run preview`
2. Click "Click to see the transformation"
3. Wait for the demo to complete (about 15-20 seconds)
4. Verify you see "Documentation generated and synchronized"
5. Click "View Detailed Documentation"
6. Verify the ticket overlay appears with full documentation
7. Close the overlay (X button or click backdrop)
8. Verify "See More Scenarios" button appears
9. Click it to see the next scenario

## Why This Fix Works

- **Specificity**: Using `!important` ensures our show styles override the hide styles
- **Completeness**: All three demo elements (split-view, doc-output, reset) are fixed
- **Critical CSS**: Fix is in the inline CSS so it loads immediately
- **Simplicity**: No JavaScript changes needed, pure CSS solution

## Future Improvements

Consider refactoring to:
1. Use visibility instead of display for smoother animations
2. Move display logic to JavaScript for better control
3. Reduce reliance on critical CSS for interactive elements
